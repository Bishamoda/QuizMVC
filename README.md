# QuizMVC

#How it works

After starting the application, the user enters the main menu. He can choose the number of questions: 5 or 10.

Next, the user starts the game. In the game itself, the question appears by chance. If the user does not know the answer, it can use a 50/50 tip.

Depending on the number of questions, points are accrued differently. For example, the 5 questions will be 200,000 points.  
For 10 questions, the cost will be 100,000 points.

If the user chooses an incorrect answer, then the game ends.

If the user selects the correct answers and recruits 1,000,000 points, then the game ends. Victory!

Good luck and go to your million!
